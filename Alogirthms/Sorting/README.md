# Sorting

- Every language implements their .sort method in their own way => this can lead to unexpected results
- JavaScript [2, 65, 34, 2, 1, 7, 8] => [1, 2, 2, 34, 65, 7, 8]
    - It converts the first index to a string/unicode and compares the values
    
- There are time and space complexity tradeoffs between using each sorting algorithm:
